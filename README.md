# Bulldozer Price Regression 🚜📉

Welcome to the Bulldozer Price Regression repository! This project aims to predict the prices of bulldozers using regression techniques.

## Overview 📋

This repository contains Jupyter notebook that demonstrate:

- Data preprocessing steps to clean and prepare bulldozer price data 🛠️
- Implementation of various regression models, including:
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forest Regression 🌲
  - Support Vector Regression
- Evaluation of models using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared 📊
- Detailed documentation on how to use the code and replicate the results 📚

## Contents 📦

- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks demonstrating the entire workflow from data preprocessing to model evaluation 📓

## Result 🖼️

This screenshot demonstrates the output of our regression model applied to bulldozer price prediction.
